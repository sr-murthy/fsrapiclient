# Security Policy

## Dependencies & Security Updates

Currently, the only external dependency is [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Security / vulnerability alerts are addressed as they arise from [Dependabot alerts](https://github.com/sr-murthy/fsrapiclient/security/dependabot).

The project is enabled with a number of features to ensure security, including [CodeQL analysis](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning-with-codeql), 
[Dependabot alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts) and [secrets scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Any vulnerability that could potentially impact package installation, performance or results should be reported privately via email to the maintainer: [s.murthy@tutanota.com](s.murthy@tutanota.com).
