=================================
Understanding the FS Register API
=================================

The package functionality reflects the current version (``V0.1``) of the `FS Register <https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/financial-services-register>`_ `API <https://register.fca.org.uk/Developer/s/>`_. The API is documented but access requires registration.

The base URL for all API requests is:

.. code:: shell

   https://register.fca.org.uk/services/V0.1

.. _fs-register-api.resources-and-request-types:

Resources and Endpoints
=======================

There are three main categories of resource about which information can be requested from the register via API endpoints:

- **firms** - authorised and/or regulated firms (either current or past) involved with the provision of regulated products and/or services. Firms in the register have unique **firm reference numbers (FRN)** and their endpoints usually take these as one of the parameters. They are described in more detail :ref:`here <fs-register-api.firm-requests>`.
- **individuals** - individuals associated with the type of firms described above, either current or past.  Individuals in the register have unique **individual reference numbers (IRN)** and their endpoints usually take these as one of the parameters. They are described in more detail :ref:`here <fs-register-api.individual-requests>`.
- **funds** - investment funds or collective investment schemes (CIS),including subfunds of funds. Funds in the register have unique **product reference numbers (PRN)** and their endpoints usually take these as one of the parameters. They are described in more detail :ref:`here <fs-register-api.fund-requests>`.

There are also search endpoints that allow a search for *(a)* any of these resources by a name substring and a corresponding type specification (firm, individual, or fund), or *(b)* `regulated markets <https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/glossary/G978.html?date=2007-01-20>`_. These are described in more detail :ref:`here <fs-register-api.common-search-requests>`.

.. _fs-register-api.request-headers:

Request Headers
===============

The FS Register API is read-only - all requests must use ``GET``, and include headers containing the API username and key:

.. code:: shell

   ACCEPT: application/json
   X-AUTH-EMAIL: <signup email / API username>
   X-AUTH-KEY: <API key>

.. _fs-register-api.rate-limiting:

Rate Limiting
=============

According to the `API documentation <https://register.fca.org.uk/Developer/s/>`_ **rate limiting** is applied to set a **maximum of 50 requests per 10 seconds per user**, and **breaches** lead to `(HTTP 429) errors <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429>`__ and **requests being blocked for 1 minute**.

.. warning::

   Please use the API and this library responsibly, and do not make excessive requests or use it in an otherwise inappropriate way.

.. _fs-register-api.firm-requests:

Firms in the FS Register are identified by unique firm reference numbers (FRN). The following table summarises firm-specific API endpoints. For further details consult the `API documentation <https://register.fca.org.uk/Developer/s/>`_.

.. _fs-register-api.common-search-requests:

Common Search Requests
======================

The common search API endpoint is a parameterised search endpoint which is summarised below.

.. list-table::
   :align: left
   :widths: 75 15 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - API Endpoint
     - Request Method
     - Search Parameters
   * - ``/V0.1/Search``
     - GET
     - ``q`` (resource name), ``type`` (resource type - ``'firm'``, ``'individual'``, or ``'fund'``)

Requests should be of the form:

.. code:: http

   GET https://register.fca.org.uk/services/V0.1/Search?q=resource_name&type=resource_type HTTP/1.1

For example, here are a few valid common search requests.

* Common search for Barclays Bank Plc (FRN #122702):

.. code:: http

   GET https://register.fca.org.uk/services/V0.1/Search?q=Barclays+Bank+plc&type=firm HTTP/1.1

* Common search for Hastings Insurance Services Limited (FRN #311492)

.. code:: http
   
   GET https://register.fca.org.uk/services/V0.1/Search?q=hastings+insurance+services&type=firm HTTP/1.1

* Common search for all Natwest-related firms:

.. code:: http
   
   GET https://register.fca.org.uk/services/V0.1/Search?q=Natwest&type=firm HTTP/1.1

* Common search for a specific individual, Mark Carney (IRN #MXC29012):

.. code:: http
   
   GET https://register.fca.org.uk/services/V0.1/Search?q=mark+carney&type=individual HTTP/1.1

* Common search for a generic individual name "John Smith", with multiple results:

.. code:: http
   
   GET https://register.fca.org.uk/services/V0.1/Search?q=John+Smith&type=individual HTTP/1.1

* Common search for a specific fund, Jupiter Asia Pacific Income (PRN #635641):

.. code:: http
   
   GET https://register.fca.org.uk/services/V0.1/Search?q=jupiter+asia+pacific+income&type=fund HTTP/1.1

* Common search for a specific fund, abrdn Multi-Asset Fund (PRN #637980):

.. code:: http
   
   GET https://register.fca.org.uk/services/V0.1/Search?q=abrdn+multi-asset+fund&type=fund HTTP/1.1

One particular type of common search-based endpoint that the API provides separately is for `regulated markets <https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/glossary/G978.html?date=2007-01-20>`_. These are special markets which are regulated by UK and/or EU/EEA financial legislation. API requests for regulated markets should look as below:

.. code:: http

   GET https://register.fca.org.uk/services/V0.1/CommonSearch?q=RM HTTP/1.1
