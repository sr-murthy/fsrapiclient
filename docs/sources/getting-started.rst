Getting Started
===============

This is a `PyPI package <https://pypi.org/project/fsrapiclient/>`_, and the source is on `GitHub <https://github.com/sr-murthy/fsrapiclient>`_. The package is tested on Python 3.12 & 3.13 (on Linux, Windows and macOS), but should also install fine on earlier Python versions.

Installation
============

A standard :program:`pip` install (with the :code:`-U` "upgrade" option to get the latest version) is sufficient:

.. code:: python

   pip install -U fsrapiclient

This will install `requests <https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ (and its sub-dependencies), as this is currently the only top-level dependency.
