# fsrapiclient

A lightweight Python client library for the UK [Financial Services Register (FS Register)](https://register.fca.org.uk/s/) [RESTful API](https://register.fca.org.uk/Developer/s/).

The FS Register is a **public** database of all firms, individuals, funds, and other entities, that are either currently, or have been previously, authorised and/or regulated by the UK [Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)](https://www.fca.org.uk) and/or the [Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA)](http://bankofengland.co.uk/pra).

> [!NOTE]
> The FS Register API is free to use but accessing it, including via this library, requires [registration](https://register.fca.org.uk/Developer/ShAPI_LoginPage?ec=302&startURL=%2FDeveloper%2Fs%2F#). Registration involves a free sign up with an email, which is used as the API username in requests, and basic personal information. Once registered an API key is available from your registration profile - the API key can be used in request headers to programmatically make requests via any suitable language and library of choice.

See the [Sphinx documentation](https://fsrapiclient.readthedocs.io) for more details on:
